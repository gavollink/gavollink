## The Account ReadMe Template

Templates are useful, but I'm probably doing it wrong.

- 👀 I’m interested in ...
  - Early CRT Terminals
    - And how we're still "stuck" with that legacy
  - File Formats / Data Structures
  - Machine Learning (not Generative/Adversarial AI)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - Python
  - Rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
  - Collaborate?  I try, but it's a struggle.
- 📫 How to reach me ...

  - More likely, an issue on one of the Repositories I'll be mirroring here.
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
  - he/him
    - Just an old guy, nothing interesting
- ⚡ Fun facts: ...
  - My first tech job was working for a company that primarily did phone sex.
  - I'm fairly liberal for an old white guy
    - Take that however you like, but liberal upsets you, just avoid talking about your politics.
  - I have two rackmount servers in my living room...
    - One of them runs my personal git service.
    - One of my A/C units died, and my Rack Mount servers won't run if the temp is over ~86F/30C
    - It'll still be another ??? before the replacement happens
      - First replacement was DOA, trying to get the resolved is wrapped up in "customer service"
    - Looks like my public projects are going to be copied out to github.
